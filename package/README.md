## How to Use

### Quick Start

1. **Download and run** `AudioCapture.exe`
2. **Select audio sources** - Check the boxes next to the applications, devices, or system audio you want to record
3. **Select output formats** - Check WAV, MP3, Opus, or FLAC (or multiple formats)
4. **Choose output folder** - Click "Browse" to select where files will be saved
5. **Select capture mode**:
   - **Single File Mode** - Mix all sources into one file
   - **Multiple Files Mode** - Create separate files for each source
   - **Both Modes** - Create both mixed and separate files
6. **Click "Start"** to begin recording
7. **Click "Stop"** when finished

### Audio Sources

The application can capture audio from:

**Processes** üñ•Ô∏è
- Individual applications (Chrome, Discord, games, etc.)
- Shows currently running applications with audio output
- Windows 10 Build 19041+ required

**System Audio** üîä
- All audio playing through your speakers/headphones
- Useful for capturing everything at once
- Works on all Windows versions

**Input Devices** üéôÔ∏è
- Microphones, line-in, and other recording devices
- Shows all available audio input devices
- Real-time monitoring available

### Output Formats

**WAV** - Uncompressed, highest quality, large file size
**MP3** - Good quality, smaller files, widely compatible
**Opus** - Modern codec, best quality-to-size ratio, small files
**FLAC** - Lossless compression, perfect quality, medium file size

### Output Devices

Check audio devices (headphones/speakers) to monitor your recording in real-time. This lets you hear what you're capturing as it happens.

### Capture Modes

**Single File Mode**
- All checked sources are mixed together
- Creates one output file per format
- Example: `capture_20250113_140530.mp3`

**Multiple Files Mode**
- Each source gets its own file
- File names include the source name
- Example: `Chrome_capture_20250113_140530.mp3`

**Both Modes**
- Creates both mixed and separate files
- Best for flexibility in post-production
- Example: `capture_20250113_140530.mp3` (mixed) + `Chrome_capture_20250113_140530.mp3` (separate)

### Dynamic Recording

You can add or remove sources and outputs **while recording**:

- **Add a source** - Check its box in the list while recording is active
- **Remove a source** - Uncheck its box while recording
- **Add an output** - Check an output format while recording
- **Remove an output** - Uncheck an output format while recording

Perfect for:
- Starting recording before opening an application
- Adding your microphone mid-recording
- Switching from WAV to MP3 to save space
- Monitoring with headphones after starting

### Volume Control

Each source has an independent volume slider:
- Drag the slider to adjust volume (0-200%)
- 100% is the original volume
- Changes affect file recordings
- Does not affect real-time monitoring to devices

### Settings

**Bitrate** - For MP3 and Opus files (higher = better quality, larger files)
- MP3: 128-320 kbps recommended
- Opus: 64-256 kbps recommended

**FLAC Compression** - For FLAC files (0-8, higher = smaller files)
- Level 5 recommended for best balance
- Does not affect quality (lossless)

**Output Path** - Where your recordings are saved
- Defaults to your user folder
- Files are automatically named with timestamps

### Keyboard Shortcuts

AudioCapture supports several keyboard shortcuts for quick access:

- **F5** or **Ctrl+R** - Refresh the list of available audio sources
- **Ctrl+S** - Start/Stop recording
- **Ctrl+O** - Open the folder browser to choose output path
- **Space** - Toggle checkbox for the selected item in either list (sources or outputs)

**Tip:** Use Tab to navigate between controls, and Space to quickly check/uncheck sources and outputs.

## Tips and Tricks

### Recording a Game with Voice Chat

1. Check the game process
2. Check Discord/TeamSpeak process
3. Check your microphone
4. Select "Both Modes" to get:
   - Mixed file with everything
   - Separate game audio file
   - Separate voice chat file
   - Separate microphone file

### Recording Music from Spotify

1. Check the Spotify process
2. Select output format (MP3 or FLAC recommended)
3. Click Start before playing the song
4. Files are saved with timestamps

### Creating a Podcast

1. Check your microphone
2. Optionally add system audio for background music
3. Use FLAC or WAV for editing quality
4. Convert to MP3 later for distribution

### Troubleshooting

**"No audio sources found"**
- Make sure the application is playing audio
- Click the refresh button (üîÑ) to update the list
- Some applications require running AudioCapture as Administrator

**"Cannot add source" error**
- The source may have stopped playing audio
- Try refreshing the list and checking again

**Choppy or missing audio**
- Close other recording software
- Reduce the number of simultaneous captures
- Use a faster storage device (SSD recommended)

**Files not created when adding outputs dynamically**
- Make sure at least one source is checked and recording
- Check that the output folder is accessible
- Verify disk space is available

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need to install anything?**
A: No! AudioCapture.exe is a standalone executable.

**Q: Is this legal?**
A: Yes, recording audio on your own computer for personal use is legal. Respect copyright and privacy laws when recording content.

**Q: Does it work with protected content (Netflix, Spotify)?**
A: Some applications may use DRM protection. AudioCapture captures the audio that reaches your audio device, which may work with some protected content for personal use only.

**Q: Can I use this for streaming?**
A: AudioCapture is designed for recording. For streaming, you may want to use OBS or similar software with virtual audio cables.

**Q: Why can't I capture from some applications?**
A: Elevated (Administrator) applications require AudioCapture to also run as Administrator. Some applications may also use exclusive audio modes that prevent capture.

**Q: What's the difference between "System Audio" and capturing individual apps?**
A: System Audio captures everything playing through your speakers. Individual app capture gives you separate control and files for each application.

## Developer Notes

### Building from Source

**Requirements:**
- Visual Studio 2019 or later with C++ Desktop Development
- CMake 3.15 or later
- vcpkg for dependency management
- Windows SDK 10.0.19041.0 or later

**Dependencies (install via vcpkg):**
```cmd
vcpkg install libflac:x64-windows-static-mt opus:x64-windows-static-mt libogg:x64-windows-static-mt nlohmann-json:x64-windows-static-mt
```

**Build:**
```cmd
build.bat
```

The executable will be output to `build\bin\Release\AudioCapture.exe`

### Architecture

AudioCapture uses a session-based architecture with four main components:

**InputSource** - Captures audio from various origins (processes, devices, system audio)
**OutputDestination** - Writes audio to files or devices
**AudioMixer** - Combines multiple sources with automatic format conversion
**CaptureManager** - Coordinates sources, destinations, and routing

Key design principles:
- Each source runs on its own capture thread
- Async writes prevent audio dropouts
- Lock-free design where possible for real-time performance
- Dynamic reconfiguration without stopping capture

### API Overview

The application is built on a library that can be used programmatically:

```cpp
// Create managers
CaptureManager manager;
InputSourceManager sourceManager;

// Configure capture
CaptureConfig config;
config.sources.push_back(mySource);
config.destinations.push_back(myDestination);

// Start capture
UINT32 sessionId = manager.StartCaptureSession(config);

// Add sources dynamically
manager.AddInputSource(sessionId, anotherSource);

// Stop capture
manager.StopCaptureSession(sessionId);
```

See the full code for complete API documentation.

### Performance Characteristics

- **Input Latency**: ~10ms (WASAPI buffer)
- **Processing**: <1ms (mixing/routing)
- **Output Latency**: Async queue (file), ~10ms (device)
- **Total Round-trip**: ~20-30ms (input to monitor)

### Thread Safety

- Input sources run on dedicated capture threads
- Output destinations use async write queues
- Mixer uses minimal mutex locking
- Manager callbacks complete in <1ms for real-time audio

### Known Limitations

- Per-process capture requires Windows 10 Build 19041+
- Cannot capture from elevated processes without running elevated
- Real-time monitoring adds ~20-30ms latency
- Some devices may not support all sample rates
